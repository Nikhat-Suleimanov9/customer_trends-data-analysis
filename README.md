# Customer Trends Data Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes customer shopping behavior using transactional retail data to uncover spending patterns, customer segments, product performance, and subscription trends. The goal is to support data-driven business decisions through a combination of Python, SQL, and Power BI.

The analysis is based on 3,900 customer purchase records across multiple product categories and customer demographics.

## Tech Stack

* Python: pandas, numpy (data cleaning, feature engineering, EDA)
* PostgreSQL: SQL-based business analysis
* Power BI: Interactive dashboard and visualization


---

## Dataset Summary

* Rows: 3,900
* Columns: 17

### Key Features

* Customer Demographics: Age, Gender, Location, Subscription Status
* Purchase Details: Item Purchased, Category, Purchase Amount, Season, Size, Color
* Shopping Behavior: Discount Applied, Promo Code Used, Previous Purchases, Purchase Frequency, Review Rating, Shipping Type

### Data Quality

* Missing values: 37 nulls in the review_rating column

## Data Preparation & Feature Engineering (Python)

Data preprocessing and exploratory analysis were performed in Python before loading the data into PostgreSQL.

### Steps Performed

* Data Loading & Inspection

  * Imported data using pandas
  * Reviewed structure with df.info() and summary statistics with df.describe()

* Missing Value Treatment

  * Imputed missing review_rating values using the median rating per product category

* Column Standardization

  * Renamed all columns to snake_case for consistency and SQL compatibility

* Feature Engineering

  * Created age_group by binning customer ages
  * Derived purchase_frequency_days from purchase history

* Data Consistency Check

  * Identified redundancy between discount_applied and promo_code_used
  * Dropped promo_code_used to avoid duplication

* Database Integration

  * Loaded the cleaned DataFrame into PostgreSQL for analytical querying

## SQL Analysis (PostgreSQL)

The cleaned dataset was analyzed using SQL to answer key business questions.

### Key Business Questions Answered

1. Revenue by Gender
   Compared total revenue generated by male vs. female customers.

2. High-Spending Discount Users
   Identified customers who used discounts but still spent above the average purchase amount.

3. Shipping Type Comparison
   Compared average purchase amounts between Standard and Express shipping.

4. Subscribers vs. Non-Subscribers
   Analyzed average spend and total revenue by subscription status.

5. Discount-Dependent Products
   Identified the top 5 products with the highest percentage of discounted purchases.

6. Top 3 Products per Category
   Ranked the most purchased products within each category using window functions.

7. Repeat Buyers & Subscription Behavior
   Examined whether customers with more than 5 previous purchases are more likely to subscribe.

8. Revenue by Age Group
   Calculated total revenue contribution across different age segments.

## Power BI Dashboard

An interactive Power BI dashboard was created to visualize:

* Revenue distribution by gender and age group
* Subscription vs. non-subscription performance
* Product category and item-level trends
* Shipping type impact on spending

## Key Business Insights

High-Spending Discount Users Are Highly Valuable
A segment of customers consistently uses discounts while maintaining above-average purchase values. This indicates that discounts do not necessarily reduce revenue and can be leveraged to retain high-value customers.

Top Products Drive Category Performance
A small number of products dominate sales within each category. Promoting these top-performing items can significantly increase overall conversion rates and revenue.

Express Shipping Correlates with Higher Spend
Customers who select express shipping tend to have higher average purchase amounts, suggesting that shipping options can be used strategically to encourage larger baskets.

Revenue Patterns Differ by Gender
Revenue contribution varies between genders, highlighting opportunities for gender-based personalization in product recommendations and marketing campaigns.

High-Revenue Age Groups Lead Sales Contribution
Certain age groups contribute a disproportionate share of total revenue, indicating that age-based targeting can improve marketing efficiency.

Customer Reviews Influence Trust and Recommendations
Missing review ratings reduce data completeness and may impact customer trust. Improving review collection can strengthen product credibility and enhance recommendation accuracy.
